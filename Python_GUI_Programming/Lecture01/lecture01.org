* Lecture 1 Introduction
** Recommends PyCharm
** Based on Rapid GUI Development with Python and QT by Summerfield
*** Good Resource book, but dry
** QT
*** Currently owned by Digia
*** Originally in C++, lots of language bindings (PyQT (GPL), PySide (LGPL)  and PythonForQT)
*** We use PySide in this class -- Documentation is written in Python, PyQT docs are in C++
*** Cross Platform -- pretty much any target
*** Attempts to look like native platform
*** Much more than a GUI toolkit
** Important Web Sites
*** http://qt.digia.com  Do not download from here!
*** http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide -- Download binaries from here!, problems with 64 bit machines?
*** http://srinikom.github.io/pyside-docs/ -- Documentation
**** Documentation good but not great, looks like automatically done to convert from C++ to Python
**** Still on version 1.0.7 which is NOT the latest

** Using 2.7 in this course!
